# Real-Time Object Removal in Augmented Reality

Diminished reality, as a sub-topic of augmented reality where digital information is overlaid on an environment, is the perceived removal of an object from an environment. Previous approaches to diminished reality used digital replacement techniques, inpainting, and multi-view homographies. However, few used a virtual representation of the real environment, limiting their domains to planar environments.

This thesis provides a framework to achieve real-time diminished reality on an augmented reality headset. Using state-of-the-art hardware, we combine a virtual representation of the real environment with inpainting to remove existing objects from complex environments.

Our work is found to be competitive with previous results, with a similar qualitative outcome under the limitations of available technology. Additionally, by implementing new texturing algorithms, a more detailed representation of the real environment is achieved.
